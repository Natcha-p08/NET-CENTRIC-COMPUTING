This code is a simple HTTP/1.0 web server running on port 5141. It processes only `GET` requests and serves two files: `mypage.html` (a self-introduction webpage) and `myimage.gif`. If the requested file exists, the server responds with `200 OK` and the file content. If not, it returns `404 Not Found`. For non-`GET` methods, it replies with `405 Method Not Allowed`. The server closes the connection after responding.
